<h2>THE CHILDREN AT GRANDMOTHER'S.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="187" height="200" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HERE was once a grandmother who had fourteen
little grandchildren. Some of them were
cousins to one another; and some were brothers
and sisters. This grandmother lived in an old,
old cottage not far from the sea-beach. The
cottage had a long sloping roof; and there was an elm-tree
in front of it.</div>

<p>One fair day in June, the boys went down to the sea-beach
to bathe, and the girls went out on the lawn to play. Some
of them thought they would play "hunt the slipper."</p>

<p>But little Emma Darton, who was a cousin to the rest,
said, "I promised my mother I would not sit down on the
grass: so, if you play 'hunt the slipper,' I must not play
with you; for in that game you have to sit."</p>

<p>Then her Cousin Julia replied, "Nonsense, Emma! It
is a bright warm day. Don't you see the grass is quite dry?
Come, you must not act and talk like an old woman of sixty.
Come and join in our game."</p>

<p>But Emma said, "When I make a promise, I always try
to keep it. If to do that is to be like an old woman of
sixty, then I am glad I am like one."</p>

<p>"You are the oldest-talking little witch I ever knew for
a five-year-old," cried Julia. "If you don't look out, you'll
not live half your days."</p>

<p>"I think Emma is right," said Marian, another cousin.
"So, if you insist on sitting on the grass, Emma and I will
go and sit by ourselves on the trunk of the old fallen tree."</p>

<p>But Julia insisted on having her game of "hunt the
slipper;" and Emma and Marian went and sat down on the
fallen trunk, and looked on while the rest played.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day five of grandmother's little visitors did not
seem to be well. Some were coughing, and some were
sneezing, and some were complaining of pains in their
limbs.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the matter with you, children?" said the
old lady. "If I did not know you were sensible little girls,
I should say you had been sitting on the damp grass,&mdash;all
of you but Emma and Marian."</p>

<p>The cousins looked at one another; but no one spoke
aloud. Then Marian whispered to Emma, "Are you not
glad you kept your promise to your mother?"</p>

<p>Emma looked up and smiled, but did not say a word.</p>

<h2>THE FLYING WOOD-SAWYER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day last winter I was cutting maple-logs in the woods
with a cross-cut saw. It was about five feet long, and had a
handle at each end, so as to be used by two persons together.
My brother generally helped me; but, for some reason, he
was not with me then, and I was at work all by myself in a
rather lonesome place.</p>

<p>I had finished eating my dinner, set my pail under a
clump of trees, and commenced my afternoon job; but, as
the log was large and hard, I often had to stop and rest a
minute. While I was standing still, with my hands upon one
handle of the saw, all at once a bird came flying down
towards me; and, after resting upon the ground behind the
log a few moments, what do you suppose he did?</p>

<p>Whether he knew I was tired, and thought it was too hard
for me to cut the wood all alone, I cannot say; but suddenly
he gave a little spring, and seated himself right on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
handle of my saw, as you see in the picture, grasping it
with all the hands he had, and looking as though he had
come on purpose to help me saw that log through.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus164.png" width="277" height="209" alt="The Wood-Sawyer and the Bird" title="The Wood-Sawyer and the Bird" />
</div>

<p>For my part, I rather think he did help me; for, while he
kept his hold upon the other end of the saw, I <i>rested</i> faster
than I ever did before. I stood as motionless as a statue;
for I feared that any movement would scare the bird away.</p>

<p>How soon I should have got through my sawing with his
help, I cannot tell. But suddenly he seemed to think of
something more important; and away he went, like a streak
of sunshine, off into the woods beyond me.</p>

<p>I have never seen my sawyer-bird since then. I call him
my "sawyer-bird" because I don't know how else to name
him. He was a strange bird to me: but he seemed like a
good friend; and I shall always remember him as he looked
when trying to help me work that winter's day.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Silver-white</span> his locks are straying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As upon the bench he sits,</span><br />
While his little grandchild, playing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round about him sings and flits.</span><br />
<br />
Calmly there, and unrepining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waits he&mdash;he is old and blind;</span><br />
But the sun is brightly shining,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the soft spring airs are kind.</span><br />
<br />
"Ah! if he could once, once only,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See the splendor of the vale!</span><br />
He, so old and weak and lonely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See the trees wave in the gale!"</span><br />
<br />
Then his little daughter, pressing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up against the old man's knee,</span><br />
With her childish, soft caressing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Filled his heart with boyish glee.</span><br />
<br />
Through her eyes once more beholding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the glories of the spring,</span><br />
Now his youth once more unfolding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hope and joy and beauty bring.</span><br />

<h2>PAPA'S STORY.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span>, papa, for another army story," said little Eddie,
as he climbed into papa's lap, and prepared himself to listen.</p>

<p>Papa closed his eyes, stroked his whiskers; and Eddie
knew the story was coming. This is it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One day, when we were camping in Virginia, some of us got leave to go
into the woods for chestnuts, which grew there in great abundance. We
were busy picking up the nuts, when we heard a scrambling in the bushes.
We thought it was a dog.</p></div>

<p>"<i>Was</i> it a dog?" asks Eddie.</p>

<p>"No, it was not a dog."</p>

<p>"Was it a cat?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not a cat."</p>

<p>"O papa! <i>was</i> it a <i>bear?</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 206px;">
<img src="images/illus167.png" width="206" height="300" alt="Papa&#39;s Story" title="Papa&#39;s Story" />
</div>

<p>"No, it was not a bear."</p>

<p>"Do tell me what it was!"</p>

<p>"Well, let me go on with my story, and you shall hear."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was a fox. How he did run when he saw us! We ran after him,
and chased him into a pile of rails, in one corner of the camp.</p>

<p>You see, the soldiers had torn down all the fences, and piled them up for
fire-wood. The fox ran right in among the rails; and, the more he tried to
get out, the more he couldn't.</p>

<p>"A fox, a fox!" we shouted; hearing which, all the men, like so many
boys, rushed up, and made themselves into a circle around the wood-pile,
so that poor foxy was completely hemmed in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a few of us went to work, and removed the rails one by one, until
at last he was clear, and we could all see him. With a bound, he tried
to get away; but the men kept their legs very close together, and he was a
prisoner. We got one of the tent-ropes and tried to tie him.</p>

<p><i>Such</i> a time as we had! One man got bitten; but after a while foxy
was caught. Then what did the cunning little thing do but make believe
he was dead! Foxes are very cunning: they can play dead at any time.</p>

<p>He lay on the ground quite still, while he was tied, and the rope was
made fast to a tree. When we all stepped back, he tried again to get away.
The rope held him fast; but he bit so nearly through it, that we feared we
should lose him, after all.</p>

<p>So off rushed one of the boys, and borrowed a chain from one of the
wagons at headquarters. With this Master Fox was made quite secure.</p>

<p>We tried to tame him; for, being away from all little children, we were
glad of any thing to pet. But it was of no use; for, even when foxes are
taken very young, they cannot be tamed. They do not attach themselves
to men, as dogs and some other animals do. He would not play with us at
all; but we enjoyed watching him, as we had not many amusements.</p>

<p>One day we had to go off on a march, and left our little fox tied to a
tree. When we came back, he was gone. We never knew how he got
away; but we were not very sorry, for he was not happy with us. It was
much better for him to be in the woods with his own friends. If he was
smart enough to stay there, he may be living now; but he must be a pretty
old fox by this time.</p></div>

<p>Here papa stopped; and his little boy drew a long breath,
as though very glad that the little fox got into the woods
again.</p>

<h2>ABOUT BEES.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/illus171.png" width="203" height="600" alt="L" title="L" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />OUDLY weeping, I ran to my
father from the garden, a bee
having stung me in the hand.
He drew out the sting, washed
my swollen hand in cool water,
told me about those wonderful creatures
the bees, and promised to take
me to visit a gentleman who kept
many hives of them.</div>

<p>So, the first fine day, we walked
to a neighboring village, and found
the bee-master, as he was called, very
glad to show us his little pets. He
first led us to a hive made wholly of
glass, so that we might watch the
bees at their labors.</p>

<p>He told us there were three kinds
of bees; and in the picture you may
see how they look, both when flying
and when at rest. Those marked <i>A</i>
are queen-bees; <i>B</i> are the male bees,
or drones; and <i>C</i> the working-bees.</p>

<p>The most important bee in the hive
is naturally the queen. She is longer
and sleeker than the others, and has
a crooked sting, of which, however,
she seldom makes use. Similar in
form, but smaller, are the working-bees,
whose sting is straight. The
male bee, or drone, is thicker than
the others, and stingless.</p>

<p>"What has the queen to do in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
hive?" I asked. The old gentleman replied, "She is the
mother-bee, lays all the eggs, and is so diligent that she
often lays twelve hundred in a day, having a separate cell
for each egg. That is her only work; for she leaves the
whole care of her children to the industrious working-bees,
who have various labors to perform. Some of them build
cells of wax; others bring in honey on the dust of flowers,
called pollen; yet others feed and take care of the young;
and a small number act as body-guard to the queen."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The bee-master next took us to a strange-looking old hive,
and asked us what it was like. I said, "The trunk of a
tree." He told me I was right, and that the wild bees
still dwell in hollow trees.</p>

<p>He then showed us various kinds of hives, and, last of all,
a glass globe, in which the bees had built a beautiful white
comb in the form of a star, and filled it with honey. This
he was to send as a wedding-present to a bride.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus172.png" width="277" height="327" alt="At the hive" title="At the hive" />
</div>
<p>He said, "The bees can make of any egg, either a queen
or a working bee, according to the food and treatment they
give it. The queen requires but sixteen days in which to
come to maturity; while the workers require twenty, and the
drones twenty-four. When several queens appear at the
same time, they fight until one gains the victory."</p>

<p>Honey is the nectar of flowers, which they collect with
their tongues, place in their honey-bags, and deposit in cells
built for the purpose, which, when filled, they cover with
wax.</p>

<p>Bee-bread is made of the dust of flowers, with which the
bee gets covered in collecting honey. This it brushes off,
kneads into two little masses, which are placed in a sort of
basket on the joint of the leg, where a fringe of hairs acts
as a cover.</p>

<p>Wax is a secretion from honey, which oozes out between
the rings which form the body, and is then worked with the
mouth until it is fit for the construction of the comb. Bees
also make a gummy substance for varnishing their cells,
which they procure from the buds of trees.</p>

<p>When we took leave of the kind old gentleman, he gave
me in a basket a nice honeycomb to take to my mother;
and since that my father has bought me a hive of bees.
Every summer I plant flowers in my garden for them, that
they may not have far to go for their honey.</p>

<h2>CHERRY AND FAIR-STAR.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I could</span> not have been quite six years old when I became
the possessor of a canary-bird, to which I gave the name of
Cherry.</p>

<p>There were three children of us,&mdash;myself (the oldest),
Arthur, and baby. My father was at sea; and my mother
had charge of us all in her little house near the ocean.</p>

<p>Well do I remember one cold day in winter when we were
all gathered in the one little apartment that served us for
nursery, dining-room, and sitting-room. Arthur, who had
overslept himself, was at his breakfast; mother was feeding
baby; and I was looking at my dear Cherry in his cage.</p>

<p>Pots of hyacinths in bloom were on the table; Mr. Punch,
Arthur's Christmas present, lay as if watching the cat on
baby's pillow in the basket; and Muff, the old cat, with Fair-Star
her kitten, were lapping milk from a basin on the floor.</p>

<p>My dear mother had taught Muff to be good to Cherry;
and Muff seemed to have overcome her natural propensities
so far as to let Cherry even light on her head, and there
sing a few notes of a song.</p>

<p>So, on the day I am speaking of, I let Cherry out of his
cage; and he flew round, and at last lighted on the kitten's
head. At this Muff seemed much pleased; and Fair-Star
herself was not disturbed by the liberty the little bird took.</p>

<p>But all at once Muff sprang upon Cherry, and, seizing him
in her mouth, jumped up on the bureau. At last it would
seem as if the old cat had chosen her time to kill and eat my
poor little bird.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus177.png" width="277" height="187" alt="Cherry and Fair-Star" title="Cherry and Fair-Star" />
</div>
<p>No such thing! Our good Muff was all right. A neighbor,
who had come to borrow our axe, had left the back-door
open; and a hungry old stray cat had suddenly made her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
appearance. Muff saw that Cherry was in danger, and
seized him so that the strange cat should not harm him.</p>

<p>Cherry was not only not hurt, but not frightened. Well
do I remember how my mother placed baby on the pillows,
drove out the strange cat, and then took up Muff, and petted
and praised her till Muff's purr of pleasure was loud as the
noise of a spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>After that adventure, Cherry and Muff and Fair-Star were
all better friends than ever.</p>

"Oh! the chilly winds whistle around,<br />
There is ice on the old miller's dam,<br />

But a warm, sheltered stackyard have we,<br />
Where all day you may play hide-and-seek:<br />
So away, little piggies, my white little piggies,<br />
For a gambol and scramble and squeak.<br />
<br />
"You have all had your breakfasts, I know;<br />
For your trough was full, up to the top,<br />
Of the sweetest potatoes and milk;<br />
And you've not left a bit or a drop;<br />
But, though an old sow, I'll not grunt:<br />
So begone round the barn for a freak,<br />
And I'll watch you, dear piggies, fat, curly-tailed piggies,<br />
As you hurry and scurry and squeak."<br /></div><p>

Then their bodies, so plump and so sleek.<br />
Oh the glad little piggies, the mad little piggies&mdash;<br />

</div>
<h2>ABOUT SOME INDIANS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> summer a party of Indians,&mdash;men, women, and
children,&mdash;in nine little birch canoes, came paddling down
the Mississippi River, and landed at our village in Illinois.
They were of the Chickasaw tribe from Minnesota, who are
half-civilized, and speak our language imperfectly.</p>

<p>Indians, you must know, do not live in good warm houses
as we do. They live in wigwams, as they call their houses,
which are merely a few poles stuck in the ground, and covered
with skins or blankets.</p>

<p>They do not provide regular meals, but live from hand to
mouth by hunting and fishing. Sometimes they have to go
without food a long time. The men are too lazy to work.
They like better to strut about with their faces painted all
the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>The Indians who came to our village were very good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
specimens of their race. Of course, their visit made quite
a sensation, especially among our young folks. As soon as
they landed, the squaws (women) threw their blankets over
their shoulders, swung their pappooses (babies) on their
backs, and, with their little boys and girls, came up into town.</p>

<p>The Indian boys made some money by shooting arrows at
cents stuck in a stake. They were quite skilful. The
squaws offered for sale slippers, moccasons, and bags, which
they had worked themselves with sinews and porcupine-quills.</p>

<p>Their chief, a large man, whose face was painted bright
red, got the use of our town hall, and in the evening gathered
his party there, and showed us some of their dances.
Two of the men beat a "tum-tum" on their rude drums
(which looked like nail-kegs); and the little and big Indians
danced or hopped around in a circle, singing, "Ye, ye! yu,
yu! hi, yi! ye, ye!"</p>

<p>Now and then the chief would pull out a long knife, and
swing it around his head; and another Indian would draw
up his bow, as if he were going to shoot. This was the war-dance.</p>

<p>We were all much amused; and our little boys and girls
laughed heartily. We gave the Indians some money to buy
their breakfast, and they said, "Yank, yank!"</p>

<p>When they, or a like party, come again, I will tell you
more about them.</p>

<h2>PLAYING TABLEAUX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> picture of "Miss Jones" in the February "Nursery"
reminded me of two other little girls who are as fond of
"playing people" as Edith May.</p>

<p>Nearly every day in winter, when they cannot play out
of doors, these little girls dress up to represent different
characters. They call this "Playing Tableaux;" but their
<i>tableaux</i> are something more than pictures, as they act their
parts as well as dress them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for instance, one of the little girls appears as
a peddler, who is quite as hard to get rid of as a real one.</p>

<p>Sometimes a washerwoman comes in, and gets about tubs
and clothes, and makes all the confusion of washing-day.</p>

<p>Sometimes papa's great shaggy black coat covers what
pretends to be "your good old dog Tiger," who is very
kind to his friends, but has loud, fierce "bow-wow-wows"
and sharp bites for those who are not good to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes poor little lame Jimmy, who can only walk on
crutches, comes in to sell shoe-strings, "because," he says,
"you know I can do nothing else to help my poor mother."</p>

<p>Sometimes a ring at the door-bell calls our attention to
the wants of a deaf-and-dumb beggar, who makes fearful
gestures till he is fed, and then forgets that he cannot speak,
and says, "Thank you!" in a very familiar voice.</p>

<p>When these little girls have company, they often fit out
travelling parties for California, or a trip to Europe; and
the baggage they make out to collect would serve very well
if they were "really and truly going," as they tell us they are.</p>

<p>Their good-bys are very affecting as they kiss us all, and
beg us write by the first mail.</p>

What is Bessie doing now? I will tell you. She found in
one of her mother's drawers a box; and, on opening it, she
found some little round things something like sugar-plums.</p>

mother, who had been wondering who could have been meddling

these pills?" she asked.</p>
